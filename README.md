# dril-delivery
A very simple, bare-bones Python script that pulls Twitter user Dril's most recent Tweets and emails them to you. 

It's a bit rough, and you need a couple of things to make it work. 

In a config.py file in the same directory, you need:
- the API keys from a Twitter dev account (I have mine stored privately)
- the email you're sending from
- the email you're sending too

This project is more an example than a functioning public script, so I don't feel bad about publishing an "unfinished" project.
